Relaxometry scripts
===================

This section describes Anima scripts for relaxometry processing. 

T2 relaxometry script
----------------------------------

This script combines several processing steps to compute from a 4D T2 relaxomaetry sequence (plus possible additional images) T2 maps or multi-T2 maps following [1]. This script performs the following preprocessing:

* brain masking either from the provided T1-weighted high resolution image provided using the **-m** option or by default the first volume of the input 4D image
* computation of the mono T2 maps with B1 correction using **animaT2EPGRelaxometryEstimation** [2]
* computation of multi-T2 weight maps (modeled as three Gaussians as in [1]) as well as the myelin water fraction using **animaGMMT2RelaxometryEstimation** [1]

Some of these steps may be discarded using the **--no-\*** options available in the script help. If provided, the EPG algorithms may use an external T1 image provided by the user with the **-t** option. Results of this script are specified using the **-o** and **-g** options.
